- Where is your Team Allocated?

## GitLogger's goal is to provide you with useful metrics.

Other rankings show you who has the best and worst ticket clearance rates. 
Is that useful? It could be, depending on how it's used and it gives incentive to game the system. 

More useful information is to compare a repo against itself. Is it performing lower? 

> For every git repo, what is the lag time for closing issues?
> How does that trend over time per month?
